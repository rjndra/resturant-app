Problem:
You have cleaned-up contracts data in csv format. Your task is to create a viewer in html/javascript only to read the csv contracts file and allow the users to browse the contracts as per attached mockup.

If the contract has lat-lon defined, you should show a point of that contract location in the Nepal map as shown below.
